# ``Docc2contextCore``

Core conversion pipeline for `docc2context`.

## Overview

`Docc2contextCore` contains the deterministic conversion pipeline and supporting utilities used by the `docc2context` CLI.

This documentation is intentionally small but “real”: it exists so this package can generate a `.doccarchive` from its own sources and use the result as a first-party test fixture (F4).
