# docc2context Status — 2025-11-18

## Overview
Phase execution is healthy: Phases A–C are fully archived, Phase D tasks D1–D3 are complete, and the remaining effort is consolidating release automation (D4). The project is stable with extensive automation (`swift test`, determinism, coverage, docs lint) already wired via release gates, so focus can stay on packaging without jeopardizing core quality bars.

## Phase Progress
| Phase | Progress | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | 4/4 complete | Bootstrap, harness, fixtures, and release gates all archived per the workplan and PRD Phase A checklist. |
| B | 6/6 complete | CLI contract through internal model are closed, matching the Phase B PRD scope and reflected as ✅ entries in the workplan. |
| C | 5/5 complete | Snapshot specs, Markdown generation, link graph, TOC/index, and determinism verification are archived, satisfying PRD Phase C deliverables. |
| D | 3/4 complete | Logging, coverage gate, and documentation are archived while D4 release automation remains active per TODO/workplan tracking. |

## Active Tasks
- **D4 – Package Distribution & Release Automation** (owner: docc2context agent)
  - Status: Planning note outlines packaging script, CI workflow, docs, and validation assets; work not yet STARTed.
  - Blockers: Need clarity on macOS signing/notarization feasibility in GitHub Actions and explicit scope guardrails (Linux/macOS only).
  - Next Milestone: Finalize plan, then run `COMMANDS/START.md` to implement `Scripts/package_release.sh`, CI job, checklist template, and README updates.

## Risks & Blockers
1. **Codesigning path unresolved** – D4 planning calls out uncertainty around macOS signing/notarization within GitHub Actions, so release automation may stall without a decision or documented manual fallback.
2. **Artifact size visibility** – Packaging note highlights the need to document expected output sizes/checksums to detect regressions; failing to capture this risks bloated releases slipping through gates.

## Metrics
- Latest archived evidence (Nov 16) shows `swift test`, `Scripts/release_gates.sh`, the coverage enforcer, and docs lint all passing during C5, D2, and D3 work, so gates remain green heading into D4.
- Determinism enforcement is proven via the C5 archive entry (double-run hashing plus dedicated CI job), ensuring release packaging will inherit verified deterministic outputs.

## Next Recommendations
1. **Deepen D4 plan then START** – Close open questions in `D4_PackageDistributionRelease.md`, especially signing logistics, then follow `COMMANDS/START.md` to implement the packaging script, CI workflow, docs, and smoke tests.
2. **Maintain documentation cadence** – Once D4 coding begins, keep README + archive notes synchronized with new scripts/checklists so future STATE runs can quote fresh validation evidence.
