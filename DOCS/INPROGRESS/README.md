# Active Work Notes

Create a dedicated Markdown file per active task inside this folder. Include:
- Summary of scope and acceptance criteria referencing the PRD ID (A1–D4).
- Links to related TODO entries (`../todo.md`) and upstream docs.
- Decisions, blockers, and validation evidence collected while working.

When a task is finished, follow [COMMANDS/ARCHIVE.md](../COMMANDS/ARCHIVE.md) to move the file into `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/`.
