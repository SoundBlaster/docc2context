# docc2context Status — 2025-11-15

## Overview
The CLI foundations (Phase A) and most of the input/CLI contract (Phase B) are in place, and the logging gate from Phase D is already archived, but execution is currently idle with no INPROGRESS notes. The next milestone is to resume model-building so Phase C Markdown work can start confidently.

## Phase Progress
| Phase | Status |
| --- | --- |
| A | 4/4 tasks complete — bootstrap, harness, fixtures, and release gates are all archived (see [PRD/phase_a](../PRD/phase_a.md)). |
| B | 5/6 tasks complete — CLI/tests/input plumbing done; only B6 (internal model) remains (see [PRD/phase_b](../PRD/phase_b.md)). |
| C | 0/5 tasks started — snapshot specs, renderers, and graph/determinism work are untouched (see [PRD/phase_c](../PRD/phase_c.md)). |
| D | 1/4 tasks complete — structured logging shipped; coverage/docs/release automation still pending (see [PRD/phase_d](../PRD/phase_d.md)). |

## Active Tasks
- None — `DOCS/INPROGRESS/` currently contains no task-specific notes, only the folder README, so no work is actively tracked.

## Risks & Blockers
- **Phase B6 (internal model) is a blocker**: without the normalized internal DocC model, Phase C Markdown rendering cannot begin, and TODO/workplan have no ready entries to pick up. Completing B6 restores flow into the renderer tasks (see [PRD/phase_b](../PRD/phase_b.md) and [workplan](../workplan.md)).
- **Phase C remains completely unstarted**: snapshot fixtures, renderer, link graph, TOC/index, and determinism checks all remain unchecked, so there is no validation yet for the actual Markdown deliverable (see [PRD/phase_c](../PRD/phase_c.md)).

## Metrics
- Latest recorded validation runs (from the most recent archived tasks) include `swift test`, `swift test --filter …` suites, `Scripts/release_gates.sh`, and the fixture manifest validator, all last noted on 2025-11-15 when A3 and B4 were archived (see [ARCHIVE_SUMMARY](../TASK_ARCHIVE/ARCHIVE_SUMMARY.md)). No newer evidence has been logged since.

## Next Recommendations
1. Run [SELECT_NEXT](../COMMANDS/SELECT_NEXT.md) to formally pick up **B6 – Build Internal Model**, capturing an INPROGRESS note that outlines the modeling plan and testing approach.
2. Once B6 lands, immediately schedule **C1 snapshot specs** so Markdown rendering has golden outputs to target, then follow the rest of Phase C in workplan order.
